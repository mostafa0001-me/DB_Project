I'm working on a database course project for an Oscar nominations system. I've already created the MySQL database hosted on db4free.net with the following credentials:
DB_HOST=db4free.net
DB_USER=mmaakh
DB_PASSWORD=1234567890
DB_NAME=oscardb
DB_PORT=3306
My database schema consists of the following tables:

Movie (Name, Release_Date, Runtime, Language, PD_company)
Person (PName, Date_of_Birth, Country_of_Birth, Death_Date)
Nomination (Category, Iteration, Movie_Name, Movie_Release_Date, Person_Name, Person_Date_of_Birth, Won)
User (Username, Birthdate, Email_Address, Gender, Country)
USR_Nomination (Category, Iteration, User_Username, Movie_Name, Movie_Release_Date, Person_Name, Person_Date_of_Birth)
Belong (Movie_Name, Movie_Release_Date, Person_Name, Person_Date_of_Birth, Role)

For my final milestone, I need a client application that connects to this database with these required functionalities:

Register a user
Add a new user nomination for a staff member for a given movie
View existing nominations for the user
View the top nominated movies by system users in each category/year
Show the total nominations and oscars for a given director, actor, and singer
Show the top 5 birth countries for actors who won the best actor category
Show all the nominated staff members born in a given country, with their categories, nomination counts, and oscars in descending order
Dream Team - Extract the living cast members that can create the best movie ever (director, actors, actresses, producer, singer with most oscars)
Show the top 5 production companies by number of won Oscars
List all non-English speaking movies that ever won an oscar, with the year

Please create a complete, ready-to-run web application that implements all these features. You can use any web technology stack you're familiar with (Node.js/Express, React, PHP, ASP.NET, etc.). Include all necessary code files, proper database connection handling, error handling, and a clean, responsive user interface. The application should be well-structured and documented so I can easily deploy it.
I don't have specific requirements for the technology stack, so please choose one that would be efficient for implementing these features with minimal complexity."
This prompt allows for more flexibility in the technology choice while still clearly outlining all your requirements and database structure.
